    <p>Blogging was amazing. I learned so much over the years sharing my life with all of you.</p>

    <p>But now it's time for me to live my life without every shoe or outfit going online. Life is an adventure and I plan to live it fearlessly.</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading, <br><br><i>XOXO - Allison</i></p>
